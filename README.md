📌 Task 03 – Decision Tree Classifier (Data Science Internship)

This repository contains Task 3 of my Data Science Internship at Prodigy InfoTech, where I built a Decision Tree Classifier to predict whether a customer will subscribe to a bank’s term deposit using the Bank Marketing Dataset from the UCI Machine Learning Repository.

🔍 Project Overview

Performed data preprocessing and encoding of categorical variables

Conducted exploratory data analysis and correlation analysis

Trained and visualized a Decision Tree model using Scikit-learn

Evaluated model performance using accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score

Analyzed key factors influencing customer subscription behavior

📊 Key Insights

Call duration is a strong predictor of customer subscription

Previous campaign outcomes impact customer decisions

Financial factors such as housing and personal loans influence behavior

🛠️ Technologies Used

Python

Pandas, NumPy

Matplotlib, Seaborn

Scikit-learn

📂 Dataset

Bank Marketing Dataset (UCI Machine Learning Repository)
